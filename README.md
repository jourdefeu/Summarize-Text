# Text Summarization ðŸ“„
## Overwiew

In this Data Science project, I will go through the task of Natural Language Processing to summarize text with Machine Learning.

The intention to summarize a text is to create an accurate and fluid summary containing only the main points described in the document.

## Project structure
The datasets used in this project are:
- [glove.6B.100d](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sawarn69/glove6b100dtxt)
- [tennis.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/tennis.csv)

Jupyter Notebook containing the code:

- `sum_tennis_article.ipynb`


## Results

The text summarization system using machine learning will reduce your effort to find important and the most relevant information from any topic.
